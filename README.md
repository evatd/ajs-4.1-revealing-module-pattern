**Advanced JavaScript | Workshop 4 Task 1**

Solution to the following task:

### Task

In workshop4.js, using the module pattern, or the revealing module pattern, build a simple calculator module with the following methods:
- A method that will add two arguments that are passed to it and return the result. â€¢ A method that will multiply two arguments passed to it and return the result.
- A method that will divide two arguments passed to it and return the result.
The module should return an object containing the 3 methods that you have defined (i.e they will all be public methods).
Remember, if you are using the revealing module pattern, you should return references to the methods, not the methods themselves.
